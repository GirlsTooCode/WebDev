# Staging and Committing Files

Letâ€™s add some files before we delve in

Create a file called **`demo.txt`** in the project folder and add the following text into it:  
**`Initial Content`**

{% hint style="info" %}
Here we are just working with just plain text file. You can equally add any type of file
{% endhint %}

## Staging And Committing The File

Committing is the process in which the code is added to the local repository. Before committing the code, it has to be in the staging area. The staging area is there to keep track of all the files which are to be committed.

Any file which is not added to the staging area will not be committed. This gives the developer control over which files need to be committed.
