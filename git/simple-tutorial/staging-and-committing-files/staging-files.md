# Staging Files

Use the following command for staging the file:

```bash
git add demo.txt
```

In case you want to add multiple files you can use:

```bash
git add <file1> <file2> <file3>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
file1 file2 file3 indicates the name of the files to be added
{% endhint %}

If you want to add all the files inside your project folder to the staging area, use the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use this carefully since it adds all the files and folders in your project to the staging area.
{% endhint %}
