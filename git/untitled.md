# What is Git

Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System

#### Control System

This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides.

#### Version Control System

The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later.

#### Distributed Version Control System

Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer. I will explain the concept of remote and local repositories later in this article.

Real life projects mostly involve multiple developers working in parallel. Git is needed in such a situation to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.

Additionally, requirements in projects may change often. So Git would allow developers to revert to an older version of the code.

Finally, projects which are being run in parallel can sometimes involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important
